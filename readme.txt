Swaps the occasional "politically incorrect" term with a more socially acceptable replacement.

== Description ==

*NOTE: This plugin was meant to be funny, and to help me in learning more about creating WordPress plugins.  If you don't see the humor in it, you're taking yourself too seriously.  And who knows?  Someone might actually find it useful.*

Politically Correct swaps the occasional "politically incorrect" term with a more socially acceptable replacement.  For instance, if your author types "shell-shock", 

your viewers see "post-traumatic stress disorder". If your author types "retarded", your viewers see "mentally challenged".
